# page-model-selenium
This project showcases Selenium automation testing implemented using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern in Java. It leverages TestNG as the testing framework to manage test execution and assertions. The project supports cross-browser testing on both Chrome and Firefox browsers.

Key highlights include:

    Implementation of the Page Object Model (POM) for better test code organization, maintainability, and reusability

    Selenium WebDriver for browser automation

    TestNG framework for test management and reporting

    Cross-browser compatibility with Chrome and Firefox

    Maven for dependency and build management

    Developed using Java in the Eclipse IDE for efficient development and debugging

This project serves as a practical example of applying the POM framework to create maintainable and scalable Selenium test automation scripts.
